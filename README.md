# Translation for The Outsider

This repository is designed as a UNIVERSAL translation addon for [The Outsider mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/theoutsider/).

The sample is here: [English Slate](fig/screenshot_slate_english.png) -> [Japanese Slate](fig/screenshot_slate_japanese.png) (this is a SPOILER, so I don't display these images directly ;;) )

Now, Japanese translation, Brazilian Portuguese translation, and Chinese translation are available;
**Making other language translation is welcoming!** Please read [Other Languages](#other-languages) for details.

## Installation

Requires [The Outsider](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/theoutsider/) (Of course! This mod is an addon of The Outsider).

Next, install [Translation for The Outsider](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/translationfortheoutsider/) by Outer Wilds Mod Manager as in other mods.
