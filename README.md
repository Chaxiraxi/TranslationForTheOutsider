# Translation for The Outsider

This repository tries translating [The Outsider mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/theoutsider/).

Now, I am focusing on EN -> JP.  
The sample is here: [English Slate](fig/screenshot_slate_english.png) -> [Japanese Slate](fig/screenshot_slate_japanese.png) (this is a SPOLER, so I don't display these images directly ;;) )

## Installation

Requires [The Outsider](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/theoutsider/) (Of course! This mod is an addon of The Outsider).

Next, install [Translation for The Outsider](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/translationfortheoutsider/) by Outer Wilds Mod Manager as in other mods.

## Roadmap of EN -> JP

* [ ] Inside of Observatory
* [ ] Feldspar
* [ ] Gabbro
* [x] Others are done, I think.

## Other Languages

Please make `TranslationForTheOutsider/assets/<language>.xml` and its pull requests (or an issue). I will add it into next releases.
